## How It Works

### Password Strength Checker  
The strength checker evaluates the password based on:  
- Length.  
- Inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.  
- Password complexity.  

The results are visually displayed with colors:  
- **Red:** Weak.  
- **Orange:** Moderate.  
- **Green:** Strong.  

### Password Generator  
The generator allows users to create a password by selecting specific options.  
- Users can specify the desired length (e.g., 8â€“16 characters).  
- Users can choose to include/exclude numbers, symbols, or uppercase letters.  
- The generated password is displayed in an input field for easy copying.
